# Storage System
This project is a simple console-based inventory management system implemented in C++. It allows the user to register products, calculate prices based on weight, and apply maintenance costs to the products.  

## Getting Started
These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes.  

## Prerequisites
- A C++ compiler (GCC recommended)
- An IDE (CLion recommended)

## Installing
1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Open the project in your IDE.
3. Build and run the project.

## Usage
The program starts by asking the user to enter the number of products to register. The user then enters the name and weight of each product. The program calculates the price of each product based on its weight and applies a maintenance cost. The final price of each product is then displayed.  The user is then asked if they want to add more products. If the user chooses to add more products, the process is repeated. If not, the program ends.
